# Hello-World
1st level newbie stuff
I am a 55 year old man.  I am a father of 3 children.  My divorce from their mother is in the court.  In a few months, I'll be divorced and living alone in my bachelor studio apartment.  I drive Uber to make a living.  Currently, my landlord has 2 of my rent checks.  Only 1 of those checks will clear now.  It is the weekend, there is a float on transactions pending in my checking account until...Monday?  Need $800 more plus the $130 accumulated in my Driver App, awaiting cash out to my Chase account.
